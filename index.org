#+TITLE: A personal ELPA repository of Emacs packages

An ELPA repository of Emacs packages that I use and maintain. The
packages in this repository are:

- [[https://github.com/kriyative/clojure-emacs-hacks][clojure-emacs-hacks]] (1.1.2) -- A collection of Clojure mode hacks
- [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DictMode][dictionary]] (1.10) -- Emacs package for talking to a dictionary server
- [[http://emacs-w3m.namazu.org/][emacs-w3m]] (1.4.501) -- a simple Emacs interface to w3m
- [[https://github.com/kriyative/miagi][miagi]] (0.0.5) -- an alpha quality Gmail client in Emacs
- [[https://github.com/nablaone/slime][slime-snapshot]] (20091015) -- an unofficial snapshot of SLIME, which
  is known to work with Common Lisp (Clozure CL), Scheme (Chicken) and
  Clojure

To use this repo in Emacs 24+, just add the following to your
=~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el= file.

: (add-to-list 'package-archives '("kriyative" . "http://kriyative.github.io/elpa/packages/"))
: (package-initialize)
: (package-refresh-contents)

After eval'ing the above, the aforementioned packages should display
in the =M-x package-list-packages= list, and be installable like other
packages from the ELPA or marmalade repos.

If you find any issues or have any questions, please email me at
kriyative <at> gmail <dot> com.
